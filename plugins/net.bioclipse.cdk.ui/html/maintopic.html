<h1>Some exposed CDK Functionality</h1>

<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>This plug-in makes available a number of functions via the graphical user
interface. These functions include the following:
<ul><li><b>2D coordinates generation</b><br>
For every file containing a molecule, you can generate 2D coordinates via the context menu (right mouse button and choose "Generate 2D coordinates"). These 
will be coordinates optimised to give a clear picture. You are asked if you want to write the coordinates in the existing files (and overwrite existing coordinates) or 
generate a new file with the new coordinates.</li>
<li><b>3D coordinates generation</b><br>
For every file containing a molecule, you can generate 3D coordinates via the context menu (right mouse button and choose "Generate 3D coordinates"). These 
will be coordinates showing a likely configuration of the molecule in space. You are asked if you want to write the coordinates in the existing files (and overwrite existing coordinates) or 
generate a new file with the new coordinates. Note the 3D coordinate generation also adds hydrogens to have the molecule fully saturated.</li>
<li><b>New Molecule from SMILES</b><br>
This is a wizard available via New -> Chemistry -> Molecule from SMILES, which creates a new CML file containing a molecule you can give as SMILES. The created files can then be used 
for further editing, QSAR calculation etc. This is useful if you have the SMILES of a structure and want to visualize or work with it.</li>
<li><b>Calculate Tanimoto similarity</b><br>
You can calculate a fingerprint-based Tanimoto similarity of molecules here. If 
you select two molecules and choose this option, you get a similarity value 
displayed. If you choose one or more than two, you get a wizard where you need 
to choose the molecule to which similarity is to be calculated. A temporary 
sd file will then be created and opened which contains all the molecules and the 
similarity value.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CDK Manager</h2>
A lot of CDK functionality is available via the <i>cdk</i> manager available
via the <i>Javascript Console</i>. This View can be opened the Window menu
<b>Show View</b> -> <b>Javascript Console</b>. On this console, type
<i>man cdk</i> to get more information.
